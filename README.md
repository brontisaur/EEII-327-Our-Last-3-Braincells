# EEII-327-Our-Last-3-Braincells
Humble university project in an attempt to pass our third year Design module. Software (maybe) to (hopefully) control an ATRED that will shoot down all the things. Actually drones. Will most likely shoot nothing down at all. Our main goal in life is to have our Lecturer (All Hail Dr. Marais) not kill us. Notice us Senpai.
